	look very much like grapes.

<div class="mb-6">
	A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the
	flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes, used
	for making wine, jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed extract, vinegar, and
	grape seed oil, or dried as raisins, currants and sultanas.

	The skin on these grapes is <strong>slightly sour</strong> and
	<strong>a bit astringent</strong>, typical for any grape. But the flesh is
	more <i>delicious</i> than any other I’ve tasted. The texture is a bit like <i>jelly</i>,
	and they are one of the <i>sweetest</i> grape varieties. And if you’re the type who
	dislikes eating grape skins, the skins on these grapes peel off fairly easily.

<div class="mb-2">
	Because of how they’re packaged, the quality of imported shine muscat grapes
	is usually very good. None were crushed or soft.
